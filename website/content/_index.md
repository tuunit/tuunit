## Coder, Open Sourcerer, Teacher

I'm a **Staff Platform Engineer** with a passion for **open source**, learning and teaching. I've been coding and tinkering for over **17 years** and love to share my knowledge about software architecture and design.

I'm mostly focused on building tools and **internal development platforms** for enabling others.

My language of choice is **<span style="color: #00ADD8">Go</span>** and a healthy sprinkle of Bash scripting. Other than that, I've used quite a mixed bunch of languages over the years. You could say I'm a **coding polyglot**, ranging over all the major C flavours (C++, C#, C), Java, TypeScript, Python, Shell, PHP and Ruby.
